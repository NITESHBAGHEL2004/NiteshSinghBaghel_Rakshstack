Project Summary – PG Listing Website
1. Introduction

The PG Listing Website was developed as part of Phase 2 of the internship program. The main objective of this project was to create a user-friendly and responsive web application that allows users to search, filter, and explore PG (Paying Guest) accommodations. The platform is designed to simplify the process of finding a suitable PG by providing essential details such as price, amenities, location, and sharing type in an organized manner.

This project demonstrates the use of modern web technologies such as Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS to build a scalable and responsive application. Additionally, the project structure has been designed in a way that supports future enhancements like authentication, booking systems, and payment gateways.

PG Listings Page – Displays available PGs in a card format with essential details.

Filter System – Users can filter PGs based on location, price range, and sharing type.

PG Details Page – A dedicated page for each PG showing more details like price, amenities, and contact information.

Responsive Design – Ensured that the application is mobile-friendly and accessible on all devices.

Reusable Components – Implemented modular components such as PgCard, FilterSidebar, and Navbar to maintain code efficiency and scalability.

4. Challenges Faced

The development process included several challenges:

State Management: Handling state for multiple filters and ensuring real-time updates on listings was tricky in Next.js.

Dynamic Routing & SEO: Implementing SEO-friendly dynamic pages for PG details required fine-tuning of Next.js routing.

Responsive Design Issues: Tailwind CSS responsiveness required multiple iterations to make sure all screen sizes were supported.

Mock Data Integration: Without a live backend, I had to simulate real-world scenarios using JSON and mock APIs.

These challenges provided valuable learning experiences in debugging, optimizing performance, and working with modern frontend frameworks.
